# Terra-Caculator
Discription

The Terra-Caculator is a way for companies at any size to get information on their carbon footprint at different periods of time from a week to a year.
It is very flexable in the sense that in can provide exact carbon dioxide emmesions based on a certain country your located at and changes the 
result with different country locations. It is easy to use rquiring no tech skills at all providing you a simple step to step guide in order to provide
all the data needs. The caculator's formulas are all based on trust worthy and reconized sites that collect data on carbon emmesions and all the data the software
requires is public preventing any of the companies private information to be leaked or misused. 

Challenges

During the creation of the calculator I had to vist many different websites in order to get the information I needed to provide formulas for the software to caculate
the carbon foot print of a company. A better way of going about this was to utilize Beautifulsoup module in python to create a webscraper in order to get more information
on different countries carbon dioxide emmesions, formulas to caculate how much kg of CO2 is produced per KWH from different sources like electricty or gas. My second
bigest challenge is keeping the users
